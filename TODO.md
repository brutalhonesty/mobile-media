* The goal of this project is to setup automatic and manual conversions of video files to the requested formats.

* For now, Android and iPhone will only be supported.

Features
--------

* Upload
    * ~~Allow user's to upload their own video to the site or give a url~~.
* Check converted types requests and then submit form.
* ~~Backend will convert video~~.
    * Give a time remaining
* When conversion is done, it can be dowloaded directly or streamed.
* Create queue for shows so we can setup more than one at a time.
* Enchance by allowing query of shows to fetch from a DB or private tracker(s) and start download of file.
* Clustering
    * Find a way to use more than one machine to convert one video and merge together after completion.
* GFX
    * Enhance ffmpeg command with GFX options (Nvidia Cuda or ATI OpenCL) to speed up conversion.
